## === About === ##
A collection of random crackme and programming puzzle solutions created using **GHIDRA** SRE (Software Reverse Engineering) tool. This series of tutorials is for **complete beginners** in Assembly language (x86) and software reverse engineering (like me, lol). I created this repository because I wanted to share my solutions and approach, so anyone can learn something from it, and because I need practicing in both C/C++, ASM and reverse engineering.
